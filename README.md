Serious games usually refer to virtual games used for training, simulation, or education and can engage users in cognitive and physical tasks. The design of serious games may offer insights on usersâ€™ cognitive and physical behaviors while they try to accomplish structured tasks. In this study, we concentrate on the design principles of serious games that can be used for assessment, which we employed for our own design. To test our prototype, we conducted an experiment with control participants. Results from surveys, our collected game features, and sensor outputs were compared and analyzed with hypotheses based on previous research studies. Finally, we interpret the results of our experiment, and we describe issues and real life uncertainties that associate with sensor errors.
